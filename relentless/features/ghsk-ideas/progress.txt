## Codebase Patterns

### Binary Installation Pattern
- Relentless uses package.json "bin" field to register global binary
- bin/relentless.ts has #!/usr/bin/env bun shebang for direct execution
- Global install: `bun install -g .` or from GitHub
- Binary location after global install: checked in user's PATH
- Alternative usage: bunx github:ArvorCo/Relentless for no-install execution

### Documentation Update Strategy
- Used systematic grep search to find all shell script references
- Replaced shell script patterns (.sh, relentless.sh) with binary commands
- Updated multiple locations: README, CLAUDE.md, scaffolder, skills
- Ensured consistent command format: `relentless <command> --params`

### Scaffolder Simplification
- Removed shell script copying logic from scaffolder
- Removed bin/ directory creation from init process
- Simplified project structure: only config.json, prompt.md, and features/
- Updated output messages to reflect binary-first approach

### What was implemented
- Converted Relentless from shell script to globally-installable binary
- Removed bin/relentless.sh completely
- Made bin/relentless.ts executable (chmod +x)
- Updated all documentation to use binary commands instead of shell script

### Files changed
- bin/relentless.sh (deleted)
- bin/relentless.ts (made executable, already had correct shebang)
- README.md (replaced all shell script references with binary commands)
- CLAUDE.md (updated CLI usage patterns)
- src/init/scaffolder.ts (removed shell script copying logic)
- skills/relentless/SKILL.md (updated to use binary commands)
- relentless/bin/relentless.sh (deleted from project's relentless folder)
- relentless/features/ghsk-ideas/prd.json (set US-000 passes: true)

### Learnings for future iterations:
- **package.json bin field**: Already correctly configured, pointing to bin/relentless.ts
- **Bun global install**: Works with `bun install -g .` but PATH verification may vary by system
- **Binary execution**: Can run with ./bin/relentless.ts, bun run bin/relentless.ts, or globally after install
- **Grep for cleanup**: Used grep to find all .sh references across codebase for thorough cleanup
- **Scaffolder simplification**: Removed unnecessary bin/ directory creation, cleaner structure
- **Documentation consistency**: Important to update ALL docs (README, CLAUDE.md, skills) in one pass
- **Typecheck and lint**: Both passed with 0 errors/warnings - clean implementation
- **Shell script removal**: Two files to remove - source bin/relentless.sh and relentless/bin/relentless.sh

## 2026-01-11T20:15:00.000Z - US-001

### What was implemented
- Extended UserStory schema with dependencies, parallel, and phase fields
- Implemented validateDependencies() with circular dependency detection using DFS algorithm
- Updated getNextStory() to respect dependencies and only return stories with completed prerequisites
- Updated parser to extract Dependencies, Parallel, and Phase fields from PRD markdown
- Added support for parsing "Dependencies: US-001, US-002" format with comma or semicolon separators

### Files changed
- src/prd/types.ts (extended schema, added validateDependencies and areDependenciesMet functions)
- src/prd/parser.ts (added dependency/parallel/phase parsing, updated createPRD mapping)
- relentless/features/ghsk-ideas/prd.json (set US-001 passes: true)

### Learnings for future iterations:
- **Zod schema extensions**: Optional fields using .optional() work seamlessly with existing PRDs
- **Dependency validation**: DFS algorithm is effective for circular dependency detection
- **Parser pattern matching**: Used regex `/^\*\*Dependencies:?\*\*/i` for flexible markdown parsing
- **Dependencies filtering**: getNextStory() now validates dependencies first, then filters stories
- **areDependenciesMet helper**: Checks if all dependencies have passes: true before allowing execution
- **Parser field extraction**: Dependencies split by comma/semicolon, parallel accepts true/yes values
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing PRDs without dependencies work correctly (undefined treated as no dependencies)
- **Type safety**: All changes passed typecheck with 0 errors - Zod schema validation ensures consistency

### Learnings for future iterations:
- **Template structure**: Constitution uses MUST/SHOULD format for clear requirement levels
- **Regex parsing**: Used `/\*\*MUST\*\*\s+(.+)/` and `/\*\*SHOULD\*\*\s+(.+)/` to extract principles
- **Section tracking**: Parser tracks current section (## or ###) for principle attribution
- **Validation strategy**: Checks for at least some principles, both MUST and SHOULD present, and no empty text
- **Runner integration**: Constitution appended to prompt after base template, warns on validation issues
- **Scaffolder pattern**: Constitution copied from templates/ to relentless/ during init
- **relentlessRoot**: Defined as `import.meta.dir.replace("/src/init", "")` for template access
- **Optional loading**: Constitution is optional - if not present, agents continue without it
- **Typecheck and lint**: Both passed with 0 errors/warnings - clean implementation

- **js-yaml library**: Simple API with yaml.load() and yaml.dump() for parsing and serialization
- **Backward compatibility**: parseProgress() handles legacy format without frontmatter gracefully
- **Pattern extraction**: Used regex to find "Learnings for future iterations:" sections and extract patterns
- **Pattern format**: Patterns formatted as **Key**: Description for easy identification

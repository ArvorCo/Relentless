## Introduction

Relentless is a universal AI agent orchestrator that automates software development by running AI coding agents in a loop until all tasks are complete. It provides structured workflows for specification, planning, testing, and quality enforcement across multiple AI platforms including Claude, Amp, OpenCode, Codex, Droid, and Gemini. The system handles complexity classification, cost optimization through smart model routing, automatic fallback on rate limits, and maintains progress through git commits and persistent state files.
